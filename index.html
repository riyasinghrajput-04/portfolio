                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m Riya Singh, a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Application student currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree (2023–2026) from St. Xavier’s College, Ranchi. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and JavaScript, I specialize in developing practical, user-focused solutions through both frontend and backend development.

Over the course of my academic journey, I’ve worked on multiple hands-on projects, including a Smart School Management System using Vite, TypeScript, and Material UI, and a Smart Classroom Quiz System with a Java-Servlet backend and MySQL database integration. I also built a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python, and created UI clones of Amazon and Netflix using HTML and CSS. These projects have helped me develop skills in full-stack development, problem-solving, and database management.

In addition to my technical abilities, I’m skilled in MS Office and Excel, and I bring strong soft skills like teamwork and effective communication to every project I work on. I’m also familiar with tools like Apache Maven and GitHub for efficient version control and project management.

Currently, I’m seeking internship opportunities in software development to further apply and grow my skills in real-world environments. I’m particularly interested in frontend development, data handling, and contributing to impactful tech solutions.</p>
